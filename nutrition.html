    <h2>Understanding Nutrition</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Most people believe being healthy and being fit are one and the same.
      In reality, they can be separate states of physical being. You can be
      really fit, and not very healthy, and you can be very healthy and not very
       fit. The best benefits are found with trying to get a balance out of both
        sides, this requires us to identify the difference between fitness and nutrition.
        Nutrition with personal training is perhaps the best way to get into shape.
          Understanding what you need to eat and how much to eat is a great start to reach
          your goals. From there, balancing your nutrition with the right intake of protein,
          fat and carbohydrates will help you reach for Excellence In Fitness.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b style="color: #999900">Possible action plan:</b>
       Writing down what you eat, how much you ate and when you ate it in a food diary or using an online tracker or app.
       Figuring out how many calories you need to eat to maintain, gain or lose weight.
       Weighing and measuring your food to adjust portion sizes and ensure you’re not eating too much at meal times.
       Drinking more water instead of sugary juices, sodas (even diet sodas) and alcoholic drinks.
       Switching from refined foods to unrefined foods. Seeing how you feel after you make dietary changes. After all,
       these are changes for a lifetime — not just to train for an event. You won’t stick with them if they don’t feel good.

Assessing your progress over time. Are the changes working? If not, what can you change in your diet to achieve your goal? </p>

        <br>
        <p><b style="color: #999900">What are the right types of foods to eat?</b> Minimally processed foods are the best for sports and weight
           lifting nutrition. Lean protein, complex carbs and fiber are your best friends, especially if you're trying to
           lose weight. Your body needs lean protein such as turkey, nonfat Greek yogurt, fish and egg whites to build
           muscle and stay full. Complex carbs, such as green leafy vegetables, give you energy to burn and fiber fills
           you up and keeps your digestive system and hormones in alignment.Fats should be healthy, mono-saturated fats,
           such as olive oil, or from plant-based sources rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Walnuts, flaxseeds and similar oils,
           nuts and seeds provide healthy fats. </p>
